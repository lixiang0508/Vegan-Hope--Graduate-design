# Vegan-Hope--Graduate-design
The design and implementation of vegan platform implemented with SpringBoot and React.js.
A front and back-end separated graduate design project. Aim to implement an online vegan platform for shopping, finding restaurants, making friends and sharing ideas.
According to relevant research reports, about 4% of the population in China are vegetarians or flexible vegetarians, and the diet structure takes plant-based diet as the absolute main body. In recent years, with the increasing diversification of ideological trends, more and more young people choose a vegetarian lifestyle and advocate a "zero cruelty" diet because of environmental protection, health, compassion, animal emancipation and other reasons. The number of vegetarian restaurants on the market also has a significant upward trend year by year. At the present stage, facing this huge group, there are no software products with enough popularity and influence to serve the vegetarian group in the market. This paper is based on SpringBoot framework and react JS framework designed and developed a comprehensive software for vegetarian groups - "Vegan Hope". Its main functions include vegetarian product mall, vegetarian blog and experience sharing, making friends and communication between vegetarians and related groups, searching vegetarian restaurants, etc. The software is designed based on the separation of front-end and back-end development mode, which can run well.
